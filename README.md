My Google Sheet Sync Project
What This Repo Is About
This repository contains my "Google Sheet Sync" web application, which I built using Laravel for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend. The app allows me to manage a list of items (create, read, update, and delete) and sync them with a Google Sheet using the Google Sheets API. I added features like generating 1000 sample rows, clearing the table, and saving/fetching a Google Sheet URL for synchronization. Itâ€™s a practical tool I created to explore integrating external APIs with a full-stack web app.
Why I Created It
I decided to create this project to challenge myself with building a functional web application from scratch, combining my interest in backend development (Laravel) with some frontend work (Vue.js). I wanted to learn how to work with the Google Sheets API, manage databases, and deploy a live app. This project also helped me meet a task requirement to develop and deploy a public application, giving me hands-on experience with real-world development and deployment processes.
